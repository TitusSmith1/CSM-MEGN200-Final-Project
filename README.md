This code is for my MEGN200 Programming and Hardware Interface class at Colorado School of Mines.
My teammates for this Project were Henry Wrothert and Daniel Sandoval who also helped build and program the RC Plane.
See my YouTube Channel for Video of the finished project https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8rHDX951rChz6TMxnTbdBA. Feel free to use and or modify it for any arduino projects (please credit me and link to my YT).

Note: This is just one of two programs that are needed to run the Autonomous Plane. This program runs on an Arduino Nano that acts as the main flight computer. The other program  (https://github.com/TitusSmith1/CSM-MEGN200_Final_Project_GPS_SMS_Mega2565/tree/main) runns on an additional arduino Mega2565 attached via serial. See YT video for more information and wiring diagrams.
